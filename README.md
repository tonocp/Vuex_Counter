# VUEX Counter

This is the GitHub repository for this simple Counter APP to learn the basics of [VUEX](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/), handling the _STATE_ through _MUTATIONS_ and _ACTIONS_ and reading the changes made via _DIRECT ACCESS_, _MAP STATE_ and _GETTERS_

I'm also using _MODULE SEGMENTATION_ for a better _SCALABILITY_

### Right now it's still on development and isn't deployed
